Formiverse is a Google Forms-inspired application that allows users to create, edit, and share dynamic forms via email or shareable links. Users can fill responses, while form owners can view, delete, and track responses in real-time. The app’s backend-driven UI dynamically renders form components based on API responses, ensuring flexibility and scalability. Formiverse is also a Progressive Web App (PWA), providing offline functionality and mobile compatibility for a seamless user experience.
